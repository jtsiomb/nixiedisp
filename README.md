USB nixie tube display
----------------------
Project status: hardware design complete but untested, firmware not yet written.

A 6 (optionally 4) digit nixie tube numeric display, software-controlled over
USB, that also functions standalone as a clock. Designed to use IN-14 nixie
tubes. Powered by 12v DC supply through standard barrel jack (center-positive).

Excercise caution when operating without an enclosure, there are high voltages
(120V DC) present in the power supply section of the board, and around the
nixie tubes.
